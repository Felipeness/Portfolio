# 👨🏻‍💻 My Portfolio 👨🏻‍💻

🚀 Hello, tech enthusiasts! 🚀

Are you ready for a coding adventure? Welcome to the heart of my personal portfolio, a vivid representation of my passion for the art of development and design.

## 🛠 Technologies Used 🛠

In this project, I dove deep and explored the best of the tech world:

- **Next.js** 🌐: The React revolution! A framework that not only optimizes performance but redefines the user experience with static generation and server-side rendering.
- **Tailwind CSS** 🎨: Forget traditional CSS! With Tailwind, I was able to design a completely personalized, dynamic, and stylish visual universe in record time.
- **Framer Motion** 💫: The magic touch! A library that brought life and movement to my portfolio, enchanting with every transition and animation.

## 🎉 Why Is This Combination Fantastic? 🎉

The power of Next.js combined with the flexibility of Tailwind CSS creates a robust and stylish foundation for any web project. And to add that sprinkle of magic? Framer Motion steps in, ensuring that each page is not just viewed, but experienced.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To dive into the magic, follow these steps:

1. **Kickstart the Development Server**:
   Run the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or, if you're using Yarn:
   yarn dev
   ```

View in Browser:
After starting the server, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000. You'll be greeted with the project's homepage.

Real-time Editing:
Want to see your changes reflected in real-time? Start by tweaking the `pages/index.js` file. As you make modifications, the page will refresh automatically.

Working with API Routes:
Next.js offers native support for [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction). For instance, you can access the route at[http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). To customize this endpoint, modify the `pages/api/hello.js` file.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
